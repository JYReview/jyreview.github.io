                                    Mohamad Hamzah, 29-year-old Public Works Department
                                    architect created it in 1963 when he won the contest that 
                                    was held to design a new flag after the Federation of Malaya replaced 
                                    the much-hated Malayan Union.</br></br></td>

                                    <td><b>The ‘Negaraku’ was originally the state anthem for Perak.</b></br>
                                    It all started when Malaysia didn’t have a national anthem at the time 
                                    of Independence. As such, Tunku Abdul Rahman, who was then the Minister 
                                    for Home Affairs, organised a nationwide competition to find a suitable 
                                    national anthem for the country. After receiving a total of 512 entries 
                                    and not seeing anything suitable, he opted to use the Perak State Anthem 
                                    instead, titled ‘Allah Lanjutkan Usia Sultan’, 
                                    as the national anthem. Along with a panel of judges, Tunku wrote the new 
                                    lyrics for ‘Negaraku’.</br></br></td>

                                    Well, Greco-Roman geographer Ptolemy first named our country Aurea Chersonesus, 
                                    which means ‘peninsula of gold’. 
                                    The name was found in Ptolemy’s book Geographia, written about A.D. 150.</br></br></td>

                                    Spanning over 743, 000 km2, the Borneo Island is shared between Sabah,
                                    Sarawak, Brunei, and Indonesia. Here’s another fun fact about Borneo –

                                    <td><b>National Service Training Programme first started in the 60’s.</b></br>
                                    Most of us remember that the three-month National Service Training Programme 
                                    officially started in 2003, but did you know that our country’s very first 
                                    ‘experiment’ with national service programme took place 55 years ago? In 1962, 
                                    during the deadly Indonesian Confrontation, the government
                                    decided to bring youths aged 21 and 28 for a two-year military training.</br></br></td>

                                    in the world is located in Malaysia. The Persiaran Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah in 
                                    Putrajaya is 2.2 miles and has a diameter of 3.5km.</br></br></td>
