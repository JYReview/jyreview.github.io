			<span>Who is JY Review?</span>
			<p>JY Review is founded by an individual that lives in Malaysia.
                        His real name will be keeps in secret so you all can just know him as JY.
                        JY is a university student who always travels around Malaysia and making reviews
                        on all the things that he discover.</p>
			<span>Objectives of JY Review?</span>
			<p>One day, JY realizes that many people around him do not know much about Malaysia.
                        Even his overseas friends do not understand why choose Malaysia as place of tourist.
                        And so JY created JY Review during his free time to share his knowledge and reviews 
                        on all the things in Malaysia.
                        This web site is also for the Malaysian local as many of them actually are still oblivious 
                        about beauty of Malaysia.
                        Hopefully, more people will know the beauty of Malaysia and visit more places in Malaysia.</p>
